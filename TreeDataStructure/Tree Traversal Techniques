Tree Traversals in Binary Tree

In order to solve any problems in tree DataStructure we need to know about traversal techniques.
The most important techniques are
1. Depth First Search
2. Breadth First Search

 Depth First Search
 
   There are basically three depth first search techniques
   1. InOrder Traversal (left + root + right)
       Going to extreme left subtree and then apply the technique
   2. preOrder Traversal (root + left + right)
   3. PostOrder Traversal (left + right + root)
